This platform serves as a creative hub for crafting comics by inputting text. Its design is fully responsive, adapting seamlessly to various devices. Through this platform, users can effortlessly generate comic strips that encapsulate their narrative by simply utilizing the "Download Page as Image" button, enabling easy sharing and preservation.

As of now, the system doesn't offer the capability to individually customize speech bubbles or add distinct text to each image. The speech bubbles and text areas are pre-integrated within the panels. Time constraints prevented the inclusion of these features during the initial development phase. However, I have plans to enrich the user experience by incorporating the functionality to add tailored speech bubbles and text boxes to individual comic panels in future updates.

Despite these limitations, the platform has been enriched with a multitude of features within the stipulated timeframe, offering users an engaging and convenient environment to bring their comic ideas to life.
