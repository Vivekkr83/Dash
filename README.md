# Dash-App
Dashtoon assignment

In this website one can create comic based on text inputs.
This website is fully Responsive.
At present there is no option to put speech bubbles and texts individually to each pictures, the present speech bubbles and test areas are self added. Due to time restictions, I could not add those features. I tried to add as much features as I could in the time frame.

Below are the screen shots of the site:
