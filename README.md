# Comically
Dashtoon assignment

This website is hosted on : https://master--enchanting-bienenstitch-5b46c6.netlify.app/

In this website, one can create comics based on text inputs.
This website is fully Responsive.
The generated Comic Stric can be downloaded and shared by clicking on the "Download Page as Image Button".
At present there is no option to add speech bubbles and texts individually to each picture, the present speech bubbles and test areas are self-added. Due to time restrictions, I could not add those features. Later, the option to put such boxes on individual comic panels can be added. I tried to add as many features as I could in the time frame.

Below are the screenshots of the site:
